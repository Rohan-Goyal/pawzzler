#+title: Tree_from_file
A sample dialogue tree looks something like below. So the heading is the PC statement, and the plaintext is NPC response. Leaf nodes are response ends. TODO: How to annotate with callbacks? IDEA: Split at a certain character or seq. Everything to the right is just a lambda literal.
* BEGIN
Hello, I'm a bard. What are you?
** Warrior

*** How dare you?
*** Thog attack!
*** Don't be absurd, I have a degree in architecture.
** Mage
Thank god, someone civilised.
*** Fireball
*** Fireball
*** Fireball

* Code
The nice thing is it also works with markdown just by changing the heading character to a #.

- If line=BEGIN, create dialogue entry with resp=nextline. Create a dialogue tree with this as the root.

#+begin_src python
"""Build a tree of dialogue entries out of an org file, line by line"""
